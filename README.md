# Wax Balance Calculator 

## What it does 
Having several orders on alcor and making reliable estimation of your wallet's worth can become a pretty tedious job.
This is a simple tool that calculates a wallet's WAX balance by summing up any token amount committed into Alcor orders (live balances) and any amount that lies in your wallet (still balances).
If requested, it would be possible even sum up WAX deposited into stakes, games and so on and so on.

## Installation
Requires Node v16.0.0
Clone the repo or download the zip file.
Then install it through

```
npm i

```

## Configuration and Use
To configure it with your wallet, just go into the config.js file and put your wallet address into the `address` key.
Run the index.js file to get the total amount of WAX of your wallet
